## TODO

Based on the assignment specification provided, here are some todo's specific to this project:

Version Control (Git):
1. Create a local Git repository with a name following the format <surname>_<firstname><ID>_ISErepo.
2. Plan out the branches you'll need (e.g., main, development, testing) and document your plan.
3. Create the planned branches and commit your work to the appropriate branches as you progress.
4. Merge branches at appropriate points according to your plan.
5. Commit changes frequently and with meaningful commit messages.

Modularity:
1. Identify and design suitable modules for the numerology analysis scenarios based on modularity principles.
2. Document module descriptions including name, purpose, inputs, and outputs.
3. Explain your design decisions and how you applied modularity principles.

Production Code:
1. Implement the designed modules in Python or Java.
2. Verify that your code runs without syntax errors.
3. Create a review checklist for modularity principles.
4. Review your code using the checklist and document any issues found.
5. Refactor your code to address identified issues, if any.
6. Update module descriptions after refactoring, if applicable.

Test Design (Black-box):
1. Design test cases using equivalence partitioning for all modules.
2. Design test cases using boundary value analysis for some modules.
3. Document your test case design decisions and any assumptions made.

Test Design (White-box):
1. Identify at least two modules suitable for white-box testing.
2. Design test cases to cover different code constructs (e.g., loops, branches) using white-box techniques.
3. Document your test case design decisions and any assumptions made.

Test Implementation:
1. Implement the designed test cases in Python or Java.
2. Optionally, use a test framework (e.g., unittest, pytest).
3. Execute the test cases and document the results (successes and failures).
4. Attempt to improve your production code based on test results.

Documentation:
1. Create a report following the specified format and including all required sections.
2. Document your work at each stage (module descriptions, test cases, code review, refactoring, etc.).
3. Include a summary table (traceability matrix) of your work.
4. Discuss your achievements, challenges, limitations, and potential improvements.

Submission:
1. Prepare the required files (code, documents, Git repository) for submission.
2. Submit the assignment cover sheet, report (PDF), and zip file containing all required components.

Remember, these are just high-level todo's based on the assignment specification. You may need to break them down further into smaller tasks and adjust them based on your progress and any clarifications or amendments provided by the instructor.
